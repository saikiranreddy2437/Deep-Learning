Viva Script – EmoContext Coursework

1. Introduction
   - This project focuses on contextual emotion detection from multi-turn conversations.
   - The dataset used is EmoContext (SemEval-2019 Task 3).

2. Models Implemented
   - Classical ML models: TF-IDF + Logistic Regression / SVM
   - Deep Learning model: BiLSTM + Attention
   - Transformer model: BERT fine-tuning

3. Methodology
   - Preprocessing involved merging turn1, turn2, turn3 using [SEP]
   - Models were trained on train.tsv and validated on val.tsv
   - Evaluation metric: Macro-F1 (official SemEval metric)

4. Results
   - Logistic Regression: 0.58
   - SVM: 0.62
   - BiLSTM: 0.68
   - BERT: 0.76 (best)

5. Conclusion
   - Context-aware models like BERT outperform traditional approaches.
   - Understanding surrounding dialogue is crucial for emotion detection.

6. Future Work
   - Use RoBERTa or ELECTRA
   - Increase dataset size
   - Hyperparameter tuning
