# EmoContext-CW2: Contextual Emotion Detection Using Deep Learning

This repository contains the full implementation of my university coursework project for **Contextual Emotion Detection** using the **EmoContext dataset (SemEval-2019 Task 3)**.  
The project compares three modelling paradigms:

- **Classical Machine Learning** (TF-IDF + Logistic Regression / SVM)  
- **Deep Learning** (BiLSTM + Attention)  
- **Transformer-based Model** (BERT fine-tuning)

The aim is to classify the emotion expressed in the *third* utterance of a three-turn conversation, considering the previous conversational context.
